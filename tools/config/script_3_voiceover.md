# Script 3 - I Want to Do Hoodrat Things With My Friends

It is 2009. YouTube still looks like a Windows 98 fever dream. Auto-Tune the News is hot online. Charlie bit someone's finger. Susan Boyle's voice broke the world. The internet is wild, unfiltered, and local news clips are becoming memes.

From Palm Beach County, Florida, comes one of the most viral moments of all time.

A seven-year-old named Latarian Milton steals his grandma's Dodge Durango and drives it like GTA: Kindergarten Edition.

## The Scene - GTA: Daycare Edition

Shaky camera. Out-of-breath reporter. Police car in the background.

The shot widens. A tiny kid stands there calm and serious.

Latarian has crashed his grandma's SUV into parked cars, but he looks like he is waiting for a ride.

The reporter asks why he did it.

He answers:
"I wanted to do hoodrat stuff with my friends."

No hesitation. No apology. Pure childhood honesty mixed with criminal mischief.

Then:
"It's fun to do bad things."

The tone is casual, like he is describing a video game.

That clip hits YouTube, and the internet never recovers.

## The Explosion - A Meme Is Born

Within days, it is everywhere. Twitter quotes it. Facebook shares it. YouTube remixes it into songs.

"Hoodrat Stuff with My Friends (Remix)" gets played in clubs.

People dress as Latarian for Halloween.

It was not staged. It was not viral marketing. It was local news plus internet mythology.

## The Symbolism - When Honesty Goes Viral

The quote was not only funny. It felt true.

"I wanted to do hoodrat stuff with my friends" became shorthand for rebellion and doing dumb things because you are young.

This was before influencers and before monetized virality.

Latarian was a kid being real, and people could not look away.

## The Star - Meet Latarian Milton

Latarian Milton, age seven, from Riviera Beach, Florida, became a mini celebrity.

He appeared on Good Morning America and local TV.

Some people laughed. Others saw a kid turned into a punchline.

Either way, he became part of early internet history.

## The Aftermath - Growing Up Viral

Latarian popped up again in later years, sometimes for more hijinks, sometimes trying to live normal life.

The world moved on, but the clip stayed legendary.

It became a lesson in early internet fame: how fast it finds you, how long it follows you, and how little control you have.

## The Legacy - Hoodrat Stuff Forever

It is more than a funny clip.

It is the early internet at full power: random, chaotic, unfiltered, and weirdly profound.

Before brand managers and virality strategies, it was just a kid, a camera, and one unforgettable line.

## VO (Narrator)

Yo, remember "I wanna do hoodrat stuff with my friends"?

That was not just a meme. That was a movement.

It was the internet in its purest form: wild, innocent, and too real to be planned.

Before clout was a job, there was Latarian Milton doing hoodrat stuff with his friends.
